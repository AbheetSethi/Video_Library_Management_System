# Video_Library_Management_System
This is a project completely built on C++

## Objective

School management system will be responsible for performing various actions such as, 
To help user in finding their products easily and thus saving time, 
To eliminate manual process of storing information by using the concept of database as backend, 
Eliminating file keeping system and implementing the use of data backup options to save their precious data.

As system has been developed by dividing it into several modules, so maintenance work can be easily carried out without having any of technical assistance.

To work with this system each users will have its unique id and password through which they access this particular system. To manage and integrate various modules and to eliminate the concept of data redundancy each modules will have data sharing property with other modules as and when required. For each module there will be unique for each of their members such as family details of a particular students, student records, staff members details, student class relationship, teacher, class and student relationship etc. The main reason for providing unique id for each member of a particular module is to developed a medium of fast identification to make our coding more optimized for better performance.

## Advantages of proposed system

Existing System:
Under the existing system there was no medium to get the direct information of our videos. To inform about status of the video library to particular user of a particular video, administration had to write letter to make them inform. Users had to check their dusty files, papers and cupboards to get information about the details of their video’s publisher name, edition number and price video wise. Working employees and users had to visit the shops to check the availability of latest editions of videos released and available.

Proposed System:
Through this new video library management system all the work has been made automated and thus replacing the process of the manual work load. Through this new system, all users will able to check their video’s cost, publisher name and edition number. Users will be able to get information about the latest edition of video released and available by going through their video dashboard. Administration will able to send direct messages to the users by using their barcodes and will check those videos and apply directly to them news about videos. 

## Feasibility Study

This phase is carried out to access whether software project is technically and economically viable.

It involves following steps:-
Problem is defined
Determination of technical and economical viability
Study of alternative solution to attempt the problem a cost/benefit analysis is done.
A layout of plan is prepared to get the project executed, scope of all phases is determined.

Feasibility is the likelihood that the system will be useful to the organization.

Following feasible factors are studied during the study-:
<ul>
<li>Economic and financial</li>
<li>Operational</li>
<li>Schedule</li>
<li>Legal and contractual</li>
<li>Political</li>
<li>Organizational</li>
</ul>
